Force the screen to stay on

sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
Add the following lines to the [SeatDefaults] section:


# don't sleep the screen
xserver-command=X -s 0 dpms

sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
consoleblank=0


----------------------------------

I believe the edit to cmdline mentioned above is only useful if the system is set to boot to command line only.

For boot to desktop then adding the 3 lines below to autostart works for me.

Edit with nano editor:
Code: Select all

nano /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
Add these 3 lines at the end:
Code: Select all

@xset s noblank
@xset s off
@xset s -dpms
Save and exit CTRL x Y
